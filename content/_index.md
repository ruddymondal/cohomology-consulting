# Turn structural confusion into provable coherence.

Cohomology Systems helps research institutes, think tanks, and advanced organisations resolve deep structural conflicts in their portfolios, KPIs, and operating models — using graph-based optimisation, topological modelling, and AI-native decision intelligence.

## You don’t have a performance problem. You have a structure problem.

Most leadership teams already know:

- You have smart people.  
- You have plenty of data.  
- You have dashboards, OKRs, and “alignment workshops.”

And yet:

- Critical projects stall or cannibalise each other.  
- Different units fight over the same capacity and budget.  
- Every year, the same conflicts reappear with new names.

This is not a reporting issue. It is not a motivation issue.  
It is a **structural** issue: the way goals, responsibilities, and constraints are wired together makes coherent execution extremely hard — or mathematically impossible.

Cohomology Systems exists to detect and resolve those structural impossibilities.

## Three engines. One outcome: global organisational coherence.

### 1. Operational Optimisation (OR Engine)

**Eliminate obvious overload and waste.**

We use advanced operations research to:

- Optimise staff and lab allocations across your project portfolio.  
- Improve throughput without burning out key people.  
- Surface bottlenecks, idle capacity, and misaligned workloads.

You get clear heatmaps, concrete allocation scenarios, and immediate wins on utilisation and delivery.

---

### 2. Structural Coherence (Topological Engine)

**Prove where your model is impossible — and how to fix it.**

We build a rigorous constraints model of your organisation and apply topological and algebraic tools to:

- Identify loops of objectives and rules that cannot be satisfied simultaneously.  
- Distinguish fixable inefficiencies from hard structural impossibilities.  
- Design minimal, high-leverage changes to targets, mandates, and interfaces.

You get a board-level “coherence map” that shows exactly where your operating model is structurally self-contradictory, and what to change.

---

### 3. Adaptive Intelligence (Graph AI Engine)

**Keep coherence as reality shifts.**

We deploy graph-based machine learning to:

- Continuously learn patterns of load, collaboration, and risk.  
- Detect emerging conflicts and incoherent patterns early.  
- Re-rank priorities and allocations as conditions change.

You get a living decision graph that updates as your environment, staffing, and strategy evolve — without rebuilding models from scratch every quarter.

## Designed for organisations where complexity is the norm.

We are a specialised partner for institutions where:

- Research portfolios span dozens to hundreds of active projects.  
- Multiple units share people, labs, and budgets.  
- Strategy, operations, and finance are tightly coupled but often misaligned.  
- Small structural mistakes quietly waste millions over a 3–5 year horizon.

Typical clients:

- National research institutes  
- Policy research centres and think tanks  
- University research offices and graduate schools  
- Innovation and transformation units in large organisations

## Start with a 60-minute structural clarity session.

In one working session with your leadership team, we:

- Map the 3–5 “chronic” friction points in your current operating model.  
- Show you how they look in our structural framework.  
- Outline what a coherence audit would examine and deliver.

No slide theatre. No generic “best practices.”  
Just a direct look at how your organisation is wired — and where that wiring may be forcing unnecessary pain.
