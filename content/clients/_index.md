# Who We Work With

Cohomology Systems is built for organisations where complexity is normal, not an exception.

## Typical clients

- National research institutes with large, multi-year project portfolios.  
- University research offices and graduate schools managing grants and labs.  
- Policy research centres and think tanks coordinating multi-stakeholder work.  
- Innovation and transformation units inside large public or private organisations.

## Common situations

We are usually called in when:

- Critical projects stall or repeatedly slip, despite “full” allocation of staff and budget.  
- Labs and facilities report overload, yet some assets remain underutilised.  
- Finance, research, and operations push conflicting priorities, all backed by valid KPIs.  
- Previous reorganisations have changed reporting lines but not the lived experience of conflict.

## Example outcomes

While each engagement is bespoke, typical results include:

- Reduction in lab or team overload where it matters most.  
- Clear, agreed prioritisation and staffing plans that align strategy, research, operations, and finance.  
- Identification and removal of structural contradictions that were forcing recurring failure.  
- Earlier, cleaner decision-making for project approvals and resource commitments.

## Why it pays for itself

Structural confusion is expensive:

- It wastes staff time and budget on projects that cannot succeed under current constraints.  
- It pushes your best people into chronic overload and burnout.  
- It delays or blocks work that actually drives your mission.

By bringing together operations research, adaptive graph intelligence, and structural coherence analysis, we aim to:

- Eliminate structurally doomed configurations.  
- Re-focus resources on coherent, high-value work.  
- Reduce costly churn in people and projects.

For institutions managing tens to hundreds of millions in research or innovation spend, these improvements typically dwarf the cost of the engagement.
