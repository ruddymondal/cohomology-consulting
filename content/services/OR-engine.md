## Portfolio & Capacity Optimisation

For directors of research, operations, and labs who need a realistic plan that matches commitments to resources.

### What we do

We use advanced operations research techniques to:

- Build an integrated model of your current and planned projects, staff, and lab capacity.  
- Encode headcount, skills, lab availability, budgets, and deadlines as formal constraints.  
- Optimise staff and lab allocations across your project portfolio.  
- Simulate different allocation and prioritisation scenarios under changing assumptions.

This includes:

- Mixed-integer programming (MIP) and linear programming for portfolio and staffing decisions.  
- Constraint programming for complex scheduling and resource allocation.  
- Scenario analysis for “what happens if…” questions (hiring changes, budget shifts, new strategic priorities).

### What you get

- **Portfolio load heatmaps** by unit, role, and capability.  
- **Optimal and near-optimal staffing scenarios** under different strategic priorities.  
- **Impact simulations** for adding or removing staff, budget, or lab capacity.  
- A **prioritisation and resourcing recommendation** your leadership can commit to, backed by hard numbers rather than opinion.

### Why it matters

If the way you assign people and labs to projects is ad hoc or politically driven, you are burning capacity and delaying outcomes.  
The portfolio and capacity engine provides a reproducible, defensible way to answer:

- “Which projects should we staff first?”  
- “Where are we systematically overloading or underutilising people?”  
- “What concrete trade-offs are we making when we say yes or no to a new initiative?”

This is the foundation layer. Everything else builds on top of a clear, optimised view of your real constraints.
