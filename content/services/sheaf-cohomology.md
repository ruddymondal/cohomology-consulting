## Global Coherence & Structural Impossibility Audit

For boards, directors, and deans who suspect their operating model is self-contradictory but cannot prove where or how.

### What we do

Over 8–12 weeks, we:

1. **Map your structure**

   - Identify key units, mandates, KPIs, and shared constraints.  
   - Represent them as a graph of units and interfaces.  
   - Encode responsibilities, targets, and rules at each point in that graph.

2. **Build a formal coherence model**

   - Attach structured state spaces to each unit (local objectives, commitments, capacities).  
   - Attach boundary state spaces to each interface (what connected units must agree on).  
   - Define precise “restriction maps” that express how local states appear at shared interfaces.

3. **Analyse global coherence**

   - Determine where local rules and KPIs can be satisfied globally.  
   - Detect **loops of rules and objectives that cannot be satisfied together** under current definitions.  
   - Distinguish between conflicts that can be resolved by better execution and those that are mathematically impossible.

4. **Design minimal structural interventions**

   - Identify the smallest set of changes to KPIs, mandates, ownership, or decision rights that remove the contradictions.  
   - Quantify impact and trade-offs using your OR and graph models.  
   - Prepare a board-ready change set with clear rationale and implementation guidance.

### What you get

- A **Global Coherence Map**: a visual and analytic representation of how your objectives, units, and constraints fit together.  
- An **Impossibility Report**: specific places where your current model demands incompatible outcomes.  
- A **Minimal Change Set**: the smallest set of structural changes that restore coherence.  
- A **Board / EXCO briefing**: a concise narrative and trade-off analysis for decision-makers.

### Why it matters

If you give different units KPIs and rules that collide under shared constraints, someone will “fail” every quarter no matter how competent they are.

The Global Coherence & Structural Impossibility Audit:

- Proves **where** you are asking your organisation to do the impossible.  
- Shows you **what to change** so that coherent execution becomes possible again.  
- Aligns structures so that portfolio optimisation and graph intelligence actually have a consistent model to operate on.
