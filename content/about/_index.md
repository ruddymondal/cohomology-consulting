# About Cohomology Systems

Cohomology Systems exists for one purpose:

> To help complex institutions remove structural contradictions so they can do their best work without burning out their best people.

We combine:

- **Operations research** for portfolio and capacity optimisation.  
- **Adaptive graph intelligence** for continuous, data-driven prioritisation and risk sensing.  
- **Structural coherence analysis** for exposing and repairing contradictions in the underlying operating model.

We are deliberately small. We prefer to work with a handful of leadership teams who are willing to examine how their organisation is wired, and to change it.

## Philosophy

- **Structure precedes performance.**  
  If your constraint structure is broken, no amount of “better execution” will fix it.

- **Minimal changes, maximum effect.**  
  We focus on small structural moves with outsized impact, not endless reorganisation.

- **Evidence over theatre.**  
  We prioritise rigorous modelling and clear trade-offs over buzzword-heavy slide decks.

- **Human reality matters.**  
  Structural changes only work if they are politically and culturally viable. That is built into the way we work from the beginning.
